# Water-quality-prediction-using-parameters-
Water quality is a critical environmental concern, influencing both ecological balance and human health. Contaminated water sources can lead to severe public health issues, making the monitoring and prediction of water quality parameters essential for effective water management. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict key water quality parameters, such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and various chemical concentrations, based on historical data and environmental conditions. By utilizing advanced data analytics, we aim to provide timely insights that can inform decision-making processes in water resource management.
